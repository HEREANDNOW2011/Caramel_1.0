  utter_history:
  - text: "HERE AND NOW was started by Ruthran Raghavan, graduate of Psychology and beloved French  professor of thousands of students, in 2011 with a borrowed investment of just Rs.10,000. With  increasing student intakes, that resulted over a decade’s success.

          In 2016 Deepti Balagopal an outstanding student joined the team as Professor and went on to  become the Director. The “IMMERSION PROGRAM” introduced in 2017 was a runaway success  and set stage for the transformation and set a new benchmark showing the world how to learn a language.
          The Covid-19 Pandemic challenged us with classroom teaching coming to a halt. However, we  were quick to respond and introduced “TEF Compass” a 100% online learning program. The  success of this program motivates us to diversify into the e-learning approach.

          The “Programme Lumière” is currently being tested and will be the World's fastest Linguistic Skill Acquisition Program - Language Mastery in 3 months beating the current World’s fastest course - The IMMERSION PROGRAM designed by HERE AND NOW.

          Another interesting fact to be known: we are the pioneers in Comprehensive and Organised Business Language Programs."
